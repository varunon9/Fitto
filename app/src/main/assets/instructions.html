            <div class="accent-color rules">
                <p>
                    You will have initially 8 stones to place on board (one in each turn).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you are out of stones in hand then you can move your placed stones to adjacent positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your strategy should be to form triplet as well as block computer to do the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On forming a triplet, you will get chance to eat computer's stone but you can't eat a stone which is a part of triplet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you formed a triplet but all the stones of computer are locked i.e. part of some triplet then your health will increase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eating computer's stone will decrease its health and at the same time you get more opportunities to form triplet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the above rules equally applies to computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Player which make opponent player run out of stones win.
